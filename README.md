## 📝 Problem Statement

AtliQ Motors, a prominent automotive leader from the USA specializing in electric vehicles, has seen its market share in North America's electric and hybrid vehicle segment grow to 25% over the past five years. As part of its global expansion, the company aims to introduce its top-selling models in India, where its current market share is below 2%. To support this initiative, AtliQ Motors conducted an in-depth study of the existing EV and hybrid vehicle market in India.

### 📋 Task List

As a data analyst, I was provided with sample data and a PDF containing primary and secondary business questions. My task was to complete the following:

- Develop metrics based on the primary and secondary questions provided by the business stakeholders.
- Create a dashboard following the stakeholder mock-up, ensuring it is self-explanatory and easy to understand.
- Generate additional insights beyond the provided metrics and mock-up. I could incorporate additional data from my own research to support my recommendations.

### 🗄️ Dataset Understanding

Understanding the available data is crucial before analysis. Here's a breakdown:

- **Dimension Table**: Contains static data related to dates and fiscal years.
- **Fact Table**: Includes electric vehicle sales data from manufacturers and states.

#### dim_date

- 🌍 `date`: Ranges from April 1, 2021, to March 1, 2024.
- 👥 `fiscal_year`: Since the company's fiscal year starts in April, the fiscal years listed are from 2022 to 2024.
- 📅 `quarter`: Corresponds to the fiscal years' quarters.
